# Demo-Portfolio
This is a demo portfolio site that I have designed, with the help of HTML and CSS.
It is a responsive site optimized for mobile,tablet and laptop screens
It was also designed for the purpose of submitting it as quiz 2 of Godev Full stack development course.
It is not my main Portfolio, but just a practise project
